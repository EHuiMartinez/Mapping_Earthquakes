# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

##Tasks
To complete this project, URLs for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website is used to retrieve geographical coordinates, vector plate lines and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. The data is then added to a map to show the magnitude of each earthquake using sizes of circle markers and colors.  A legend with color codes indicate the magnitudes.  Three different maps and overlays allow different views for analysis.

##Approach
The project includes programming in JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library styles were used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
